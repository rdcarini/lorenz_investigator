Code for final project in Math 104B - Numerical Analysis at UCSB

Spring 2016. Instructor: Professor Paul J. Atzberger (www.atzberger.org)

Inspired by the textbook Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, & an Introduction to Chaos 2nd Ed. by Hirsch et al. using methods from Numerical Analysis 9th Ed. by Burden and Faires.

The final project sought to exploit the differences in convergence rates of accuracy in Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta methods in order to approximate two divergent solutions to the chaotic Lorenz system of differential equations.

Hope in the future to break up existing code into helper files for reduced file sizes and easier readability.

Any suggestions for improvement in user interface or efficiency would be greatly appreciated.
